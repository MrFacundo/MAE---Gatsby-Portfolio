  "gallery_item_1_text": "The Assisted Healing Method is a Method created by me, where I include, in part, different techniques that I have been learning throughout my career. It is a work carried out in the unconscious to heal limiting beliefs (such as not feeling worthy, not feeling valuable, believing that one cannot, conflicts with money, relationship conflicts, work, personal, couple), physical pain, traumas, addictions, states of depression, anxiety, among others. And convert those beliefs that were established in our minds into empowering beliefs that help us live a happy and peaceful life.",

  "gallery_item_3_subtitle": "General",
  "gallery_item_3_text": "Here I focus on finding the conflict to heal it in the unconscious, also applying channeling, a gift that I discovered a few years ago and that grew more and more, since it is often difficult for us to talk or express ourselves and in this way allows us to see beyond and go to the root of the conflict to heal. To continue, with my Assisted Healing Method I am able to help people with physical ailments. The procedure is the same and when the root that causes the pain or symptoms is found, it heals.",

  "gallery_item_4_text": " How to realize if we are in need of an energetic cleaning? Many times it has happened to us that in our lives we begin to feel that things are stagnant, that they do not flow as we would like, that we come across people who are not very positive and we attract situations or people that we do not like. This is part of being able to be in need of an energetic cleaning, which, carried out from love and experience, makes the person feel like himself, well, and everything flows again.",

  "gallery_item_5_text": "The Akashic Records are a universal memory of existence, and represent a multidimensional space where all the experiences of the soul are 'stored', which include all the knowledge and experiences of past lives, the present life and future potentialities. Through a reading of the Akashic Records we can understand reality in a much deeper and healing way."
